# CHAIN-SNATCHING-AND-WEAPON-DETECTION
Chain snatching and weapon-related crimes are increasing in urban areas, posing significant public safety risks. Traditional security measures like surveillance cameras often fail to prevent such crimes in real time. This project leverages AI and machine learning to detect and prevent these incidents proactively. Using computer vision, the system analyzes camera feeds to identify aggressive actions associated with chain snatching, such as sudden or forceful movements, through pose estimation and motion tracking. It also detects weapons like knives or guns using deep learning models, raising alert levels when threats are identified.

The system integrates video data with sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes to enhance accuracy by detecting physical disruptions, such as snatching force or weapon appearances. It employs context awareness to differentiate between harmless activities (e.g., using a knife in a kitchen) and suspicious behavior (e.g., wielding a knife in a crowded area). Edge computing enables real-time, localized data processing, ensuring rapid response and privacy protection by avoiding cloud dependency.

When a potential crime is detected, the system alerts authorities with real-time data, including location, video footage, and sensor readings, enabling immediate intervention. Additionally, AI-driven anomaly detection predicts suspicious behavior by analyzing movement, proximity, and patterns, allowing preemptive action. This adaptable system can be deployed in crowded public spaces or residential areas and integrated with existing security infrastructure.

By combining real-time detection, weapon recognition, and automated alerts, this project introduces an innovative approach to public safety, making urban environments safer through advanced threat detection and proactive response.
